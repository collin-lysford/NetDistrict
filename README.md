# NetDistrict
NetDistrict is a Netlogo model that lets you investigate different score functions and the impact they have on districting.

Currently, it's mostly useful as a neat example generator that can help explain some concepts relevant to gerrymandering. It's not a tool for especially deep analysis; however, a lot of the grunt work is out of the way to expand it in the future.

For more information, consult the Info tab of the model itself. That is the documentation source of truth; this is just enough to let you know whether it's worth your time to check it out.

## Setup

Download the newest version of Netlogo from here: https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml

Currently, the only extension Netdistrict uses is the "nw" extension, which comes bundled in with Netlogo. However, I have noticed a problem with Netlogo 6.x where the bundled nw extension is actually the Netlogo 5 one. If that happens to you, go download the most recent version of nw here: https://github.com/NetLogo/NW-Extension

Extract that folder, and rename the folder to "nw" if it's not called that already. Then go to Netlogo -> app -> extensions and replace the "nw" folder there with the new one.

From there, you should just be able to open the model and have it work.
